Support Agent Chatbot for Customer Data Platforms (CDP)
Overview
This project is a chatbot designed to assist users with "how-to" questions related to four Customer Data Platforms (CDPs):

Segment
mParticle
Lytics
Zeotap
The chatbot retrieves relevant information from the official documentation of these CDPs and provides step-by-step guidance to users.

Tech Stack Used
Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
Backend: No backend (pure frontend-based solution)
APIs: Fetching data dynamically from documentation sources
NLP Processing: Simple document indexer for keyword-based searches
Core Features
‚úî Answer "How-to" Questions

Provides instructions on setting up, configuring, and using features within each CDP.
Example:
"How do I set up a new source in Segment?"
"How can I create a user profile in mParticle?"
‚úî Extracts Information from Documentation

Dynamically pulls data from CDP documentation pages.
Uses a lightweight search approach to identify relevant sections.
‚úî Handles Question Variations

Handles variations in phrasing (e.g., "How do I create an audience?" vs. "How can I set up an audience?").
Ignores irrelevant queries (e.g., "Which movie is getting released this week?").
Bonus Features
‚úî Cross-CDP Comparisons

Allows users to compare features across different CDPs.
Example: "How does Segment‚Äôs audience creation process compare to Lytics‚Äô?"
‚úî Advanced "How-to" Queries

Supports detailed and platform-specific queries.
Covers advanced configurations, integrations, and best practices.
